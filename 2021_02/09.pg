Určete teplotu a parciální derivace (a tím vlastně i gradient) teploty v bodě [`(x_0,y_0)=([$x[$x0]],[$y[$y0]])`]. Hodnoty teplot v potřebných bodech odečtete v tabulce. Hodnoty [`x`] jsou v záhlaví sloupců a hodnoty [`y`] v záhlaví řádků. 

Graf k ničemu nepotřebujete, ale můžete ho využít pro zběžnou kontrolu. V grafu nejsou hodnoty [`y`] shora dolů jako v tabulce, ale zdola nahoru, jak jsme zvyklí pro kartézské souřadnice.

Teplotu určíme vyhledáním v tabulce.
[``` T([$x[$x0]],[$y[$y0]])=[$teplota] ```]


Parciální derivaci podle [`x`] určíme jako rychlost změny teploty mezi hodnotami [`x`] o jedno pole v tabulce napravo a nalevo. 
[``` \frac{\partial T}{\partial x}([$x[$x0]],[$y[$y0]])=\frac{[$T[$y0][$x0+1]]-[$T[$y0][$x0-1]]}{2\times 5}=[$gradx] ```]

Parciální derivaci podle [`y`] určíme jako rychlost změny teploty mezi hodnotami [`y`] o jedno pole v tabulce nahoru a dolů.
[``` \frac{\partial T}{\partial y}([$x[$x0]],[$y[$y0]])=\frac{[$T[$y0+1][$x0]]-[$T[$y0-1][$x0]]}{2\times 5}=[$grady] ```]
